#### Key Analytics Features:
- **Revenue and Profitability Analysis**: Visualizes total revenue, profit margins, and net profits over time to evaluate the financial health of the business.
- **Expense Breakdown**: Analyzes and categorizes expenses to determine where costs are highest and which areas need optimization.
- **Trend Analysis**: Provides year-over-year or month-over-month trend analysis to identify seasonal fluctuations and long-term patterns in revenue and expenses.
- **Cash Flow Insights**: Tracks cash inflows and outflows, helping businesses maintain a clear view of liquidity and financial sustainability.
- **KPI Tracking**: Displays key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Return on Investment (ROI), Gross Profit Margin, and more for a holistic view of the businessâ€™s financial position.
- **Budget vs Actual Performance**: Compares projected financial figures (budget) with actual results to assess performance, identify discrepancies, and adjust forecasts accordingly.

#### Technologies Used:
- **Power BI**: Provides the platform for building interactive visualizations and aggregating financial data for analysis.
- **Excel**: Used for managing and organizing raw financial data that feeds into the dashboard.
- **DAX**: Custom calculations and aggregations created to transform raw data into actionable financial insights.

#### Files in this Repository:
- **Financial Sample.xlsx**: Contains financial data, including revenue, expenses, profits, and other key metrics, which are used to feed the dashboard.
